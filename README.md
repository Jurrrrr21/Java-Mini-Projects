# Java Mini Projects

This is a repository containing all Java projects I have built over the years (Some build prior to making this repository).
All projects were built to practice algorithms, data structures, and software design.

## Projects
- [Tic Tac Toe vs AI] (tictactoe-vs-ai/) -- An AI using Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning. Basically impossible to beat. (Built on final year of University when learning AI)
